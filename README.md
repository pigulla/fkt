#fkt


Trivial but occasionally useful functions intended for use as callbacks and in unit tests.


### Installation

Simply do `npm install fkt` (for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)), `jam install fkt` (for [Jam](http://jamjs.org/)), `bower intall fkt` (for [Bower](http://bower.io/)) or just download `fkt.js`.


### API

See the generated documentation. It's not particularly pleasant to the eye, so if anyone knows a better template for [jsdoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) please let me know).
